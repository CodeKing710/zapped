Web game where you need to get back the energy taken from you, clicker game, highly addictive

Inspiration: I had this idea for this game for over 4 years, just no easy or discernable way to execute it until now

Tech used: All raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are libraries used to make this game work but they're all made by me in raw JS. I also used various web APIs to achieve certain functionality like the framerate and parallel counters. Any other tech used to make this game is linked below.
